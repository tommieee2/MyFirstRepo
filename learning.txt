What I have learned from this course

One of the most valuable things Iâ€™ve learned in this course is how to approach problem-solving with a structured, entrepreneurial mindset. By applying tools like the Lean Canvas, I have gained deeper insight into identifying real-world challenges, validating solutions, and understanding how to build products that truly meet user needs especially in communities I care about.
